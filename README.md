## Hi there 

Thanks for visiting my profile! If you're looking for a junior developer with hands-on frontend experience and eager to grow and learn — I might be the perfect candidate for you.

### Here's a bit about me:

💻 I'm a Computer Science student passionate about **Frontend Development**, **Cybersecurity**, and **UI/UX design**. I love combining design and code to build responsive and accessible web interfaces.

🚀 Currently learning **React**, **TypeScript**, and exploring **cybersecurity fundamentals**.

🌱 I enjoy building small web projects and documenting my learning journey here on GitHub.  

🔒 I'm also working on a private React + TypeScript project. While the code is private, I’d be happy to discuss the project in detail during an interview.

🛠️ Tools I use: **Git**, **VS Code**, **Figma**, **Kali Linux** (currently learning for fun)

♟️ Fun fact: I like playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/mollycwann) for fun><
