## Hi there 

Thanks for visiting my profile! If you're looking for a junior developer with hands-on frontend experience and eager to grow and learn — I'd love to connect.

### Here's a bit about me:

💻 I'm a Computer Science student passionate about Frontend Development and UI/UX design. I'm also exploring cybersecurity out of personal interest.

🚀 Currently building with React and TypeScript while also exploring cybersecurity fundamentals for fun.

🌱 I enjoy building small web projects and documenting my learning journey here on GitHub.  

🔒 I'm currently working on a private React + TypeScript project for a university admissions system. Due to confidentiality, I can't share the code, but I’ve published a [CRUD api project] to showcase similar skills and tech.

🛠️ Tools I use: **Git**, **VS Code**, **Figma**, **Kali Linux** (currently learning for fun)

♟️ Fun fact: I like playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/mollycwann) it’s one of the fun ways I practice structured thinking and pattern recognition. :))
